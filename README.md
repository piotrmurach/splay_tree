> A self-balancing binary tree optimised for fast access to frequently used nodes. Useful for implementing caches and garbage collection algorithms.

## Features

* Familiar `Hash` like access
* Easy instantiation with default value

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "splay_tree"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install splay_tree

## 1. Usage

**SplayTree** operations are similar to that of `Hash`:

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree[:foo] = :bar

tree[:foo]  # => :bar
tree.size   # => 1
```

### 1.1 insert

To assign a value to a given key do the following:

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree[:foo] = 1
tree[:bar] = 2
```

Note: The inserted key will be subjected to splaying, which means the tree will be rearranged to help with quicker access on subsequent calls.

### 1.2 fetch

To retrieve a value at a given key do:

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree[:foo]  #  => nil

tree[:foo] = 1
tree[:foo]  #  => 1
```

Note: Frequently accessed keys will move nearer to the root where they can be accessed more quickly.

### 1.3 default

You can set a default value for a missing key. This can be done during initialization:

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree.default  # => UndefinedValue

tree = SplayTree.new(1)
tree.default  # => 1
tree[:foo]    # => 1
```

Or using `default` method:

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree.default = 1

tree[:foo] # => 1
```

You can also use a block to set the default value:

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree.default_proc  # => nil

tree = SplayTree.new { 1 }
tree.default_proc  # => #<Proc...>
tree[:foo]         # => 1
```

### 1.4 delete

In order to remove an entry from a splay tree use `delete` method. If a key is not found, the default value is returned, otherwise `nil`.

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree[:foo] = 1
tree.delete(:foo)  # => 1
tree.delete(:bar)  # => nil
```

### 1.5 empty?

Use `empty?` to check if a tree contains any elements:

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree.empty?  # => true

tree[:foo] = 1
tree.empty?  # => false
```

### 1.6 each

Use `each` method to iterate over all tree nodes like so:

```ruby
tree = SplayTree.new
tree[:foo] = 1
tree[:bar] = 2

tree.each { |key, value| puts "#{key}: #{value}" }
# =>
# bar: 2
# foo: 1
```

You can also use `each_key` and `each_value` to enumerate only keys or values:

```ruby
tree.each_key { |key| ... }
tree.each_value { |value| ... }
```

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.
